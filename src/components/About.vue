      Faergria began as a vision of Zetsu who sought to create a world where creativity knows no bounds and where
      every journey is an opportunity for growth and discovery. Drawing inspirations from classic and modern literature,
      mythology, history, pop cultural media, and tabletop gaming, he embarked on a quest to build a rich and immersive
      setting that would captivate the hearts and minds among his friends.
